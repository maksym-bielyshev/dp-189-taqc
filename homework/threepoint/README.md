# Task description
Please write a program which calculates project estimates using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_estimation. It asks a user for providing available tasks (at least one) with 3 required estimates (a, m, b). After, it calculates an estimate (E) and a standard deviation (SD) for each task using the following formulae:

```
E(task) = (a + 4m + b) / 6
SD(task) = (b − a) / 6
```

Finally, it calculates the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the project based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_estimation#Project_management. It means that ```E(project)``` and ```SE (project)``` (```SE(task) is equal to SD(task)``` above) have to be calculated before making the final evaluation of ```CI(project) = E(project) ± 2 × SE(project)```. The final values have to be printed like:

```
Project's 95% confidence interval: 100 ... 120 points
```
where ```100``` and ```120``` are values of Min and Max ```CI(project)```.
